It will use a polling mechanism to check for new files at regular intervals.\n2. `TranscriptionService`: This class will handle the transcription of audio files to text using ChatGPT or any other transcription service. It will have a method to send the audio file for transcription.\n3. `ErrorLogger`: This class will handle logging of errors that occur during the transcription process. It will have a method to log errors to a file or any other logging mechanism.\n4. `SNSClient`: This class will handle sending SNS messages to \"deon\" in case of errors during transcription. It will have a method to send the error message to the specified recipient.\n5. `TextFileManager`: This class will handle the saving of text files in the \"/text\" folder. It will have a method to save the transcribed text to a file with the same name as the source audio file.\n\nNow, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and their contents."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To create the necessary files and their contents, you can use the following commands:\n\n1.
