It will have a method to send the audio file for transcription.\n3. `ErrorLogger`: This class will handle logging of errors that occur during the transcription process. It will have a method to log errors to a file or any other logging mechanism.\n4. `SNSClient`: This class will handle sending SNS messages to \"deon\" in case of errors during transcription. It will have a method to send the error message to the specified recipient.\n5. `TextFileManager`: This class will handle the saving of text files in the \"/text\" folder.
